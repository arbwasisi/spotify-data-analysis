# Exploring Spotify Data
 Analyzing the top songs of the year from 2010 to 2019

## Overview
Spotify is one of the largest digital music, video, and media services where you can find millions of songs, videos, and podcasts from around the world. 

You can take an already-ready dataset [Spotify Music Data](https://www.datacamp.com/workspace/datasets/dataset-r-spotify-music), which contains about 600 top songs over a period of time and explore its statistics from many sides. For example consider analyzing the following factors and questions, supplementing your findings with meaningful plots where necessary:
- Which artists are the most popular
- Which genres are the most popular
- What makes a top song
- What global changes in musical preferences happened over the years
